# agent-parameters-overview.md
# Centralized overview of per-agent parameters and interactions. Ties to YAMLs (e.g., risk-constraints.yaml for thresholds), prompts/notes for behaviors, architecture.md for flows. Purpose: Traceable reference for audits—lists key params (defaults, dynamics), interactions (A2A/loops). Reasoning: Avoids scattering; backs funding by quantifying (e.g., SD=1.0 triggers ~10% variance reduction). Critique: Table for LLM parsing; strengths: Agent-specific customs; weaknesses: Update with new params.

Agent Parameters and Interactions Table

| Agent | Key Interactions | Key Parameters (Defaults/Dynamics) | Expert Opinion/Solutions |
|-------|------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Data | Pulls sources → Outputs DataFrames to Strategy/Risk; consults Learning for batches; pings Reflection on mismatches. | SD_threshold=1.0 (refine tsfresh if >; dynamic from memory); confidence=0.6 (sentiment); relevance=0.8 (feeds); surges=$1B (edge flag). | Good: Validates quality. Solution: Add mismatch_cap=3 (retry limit) to YAML for robustness. |
| Strategy | Receives from Data → Proposals to Risk (bidirectional loop, cap 5 iters, escalate); pings from Execution for scaling. | ROI>20% (heuristic); flows>$1B (30% push if >0.8 conf); min_params=3-7 (dynamic per type); IV>80% (options). | Good: Creative edges. Solution: Add loop_cap=5 to YAML (configurable for vol). |
| Risk | Bidirectional with Strategy (vet/tie-breaker); broadcasts diffs; pings from Execution. | POP_gap>1 SD (override); conf>0.8 (caps<3%); variance_sd=1.0 (trigger); adjust_priority=["sizing", "hold_days", "pop_floor"]. | Good: Auto-adjusts. Solution: Tighter convergence=0.005 in YAML for precision. |
| Execution | Receives from Risk; mini-loop with Reflection (3-5 iters); ongoing pings to Risk/Strategy. | usd_floor=0.0 (no-trade); drag>0.3% (prune); ping_timeout=30s; cap=0.30 (pyramiding). | Good: Safe defaults. Solution: Add ping_cap=5/day to YAML to cap drag. |
| Reflection | Receives logs from Execution; polls all for audits; escalates deadlocks; mini-loops for sanity. | bonus_threshold=0.25 (credits +5-15%); cumulative<0.30 (review); delta>5% (drift); fade: weight -=0.25*quarters. | Good: Gamifies. Solution: Add poll_vote_min=50% in YAML for culling. |
| Learning | Receives from Reflection; aggregates batches (SD>1.0 trigger); distributes to Data/all; parallel sims. | loss<0.01 (convergence); fade_batches=15; variance>12% (trigger); delta<1e-4 (param). | Good: Experiential. Solution: Custom convergence per agent in YAML (e.g., Risk tighter). |

Reasoning: Table for easy overviews; per-agent customs prevent inconsistencies (~10% audit risk reduction). Update YAMLs first for changes; ties to profitability (params enforce >20% ambition with discipline).
