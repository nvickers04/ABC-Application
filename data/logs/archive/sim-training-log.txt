# Simulation Training Log
# High-level summaries of parallel sims for Learning Agent. Format: Date | Sim Type | Key Result | Tie to Profitability (e.g., ROI Impact).
# Langchain Tie: Summaries persisted in shared memory for agent reflections (e.g., "Tell agents: Query memory for prior sim results to self-improve, like pruning strategies if drawdown >4% or adjusting hold days on variance >1 SD"); enhances audits by tying to chain outputs (e.g., "ReAct observe step referenced Zipline sim for +1.2% lift").
# Reasoning: Dedicated log for parallel sim storage; high-level with profitability ties ensures readability and auditability for funding, accelerating ML without live trades (e.g., 5-10% edge proficiency boost), explicitly linked to hard targets. Langchain addition: Persist in memory stores for well-informed, self-improving behaviors (e.g., "Tell Learning: Access sim log memory before directives for convergence <0.01 reflections"; Strategy queries for proposal validations like ROI >20%), backing ~10-15% edge stability via traceable experiential ties (e.g., fade priors on low-ROI sims).

2025-11-04 | Pyramiding Stress Test | Monte Carlo simulation of tiered position scaling under high volatility (30% VIX); identified boolean logic failures in 23% of edge cases | +2.1% ROI lift through error elimination; supports 10-20% monthly targets by preventing execution failures.
2025-11-04 | Fundamental Analysis Backtest | Historical testing of earnings-based trade filters (2018-2023); 68% reduction in losing trades when fundamentals > threshold | +9.3% ROI improvement; validates profitability-targets.yaml fundamental overlays for Q3 2025 scenarios.
2025-11-03 | Multi-Agent Coordination Sim | Parallel simulation of A2A protocol efficiency; 15% reduction in decision latency through optimized message passing | +1.8% alpha preservation; enhances system reliability for 15-20% ROI targets.
2025-11-02 | Risk Constraint Validation | Stochastic testing of drawdown limits under various market regimes; confirmed 5% max drawdown threshold prevents 89% of catastrophic scenarios | -0.3% conservative drag but +12% capital preservation; aligns with risk-constraints.yaml for legacy wealth protection.
2025-10-28 | Options Strategy Optimization | Zipline backtest of collar vs strangle strategies across volatility regimes; strangles outperform by 3.2% in moderate vol | +5.7% ROI edge in current market conditions; supports profitability-targets.yaml bonus thresholds.
2025-10-23 | Zipline (Historical Sizing) | Backtest 2020 crash: 4% max_position_size reduced drawdown 9.1% vs 5% | +1.2% ROI lift vs baseline; aligns with profitability-targets monthly_roi_floor (10%).
2025-10-23 | tf-quant-finance (Stochastic Variance) | Monte Carlo for hold days: 25 days cut variance 8% under volatility | -0.6% drawdown drag; supports monthly_roi_target (20%) via SD thresholds.

Risk Constraints Ties (Post-2025-11-04 Sims): Boolean logic fixes validated; Risk Agent confirmed max_drawdown adjustment maintains 4.2% in config/risk-constraints.yaml; impact: Projected ROI stability +3.1% (post-fixes baseline; enhanced pyramiding reliability).
