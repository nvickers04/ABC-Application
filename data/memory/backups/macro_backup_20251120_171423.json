Volatility remains low with VIX at 19.5 (below 20 threshold), indicating complacency but potential for spikes from geopolitical tensions (Middle East) or election uncertainty. Term structure shows mild contango (VIX futures ascending), suggesting stable near-term vol but longer-term hedging demand. Put/call ratio at 0.85 signals bullish sentiment; gamma exposure is positive for SPX, supporting upside pinning near 5800. Broader regime favors risk-on assets like tech and crypto, with commodities showing rotation into precious metals amid USD weakness (DXY at 101). Institutional flows (CFTC data) confirm net long positions in equities and gold. Risk environment: Low systemic risk, but monitor credit spreads (HYG-OAS at 320bps).
