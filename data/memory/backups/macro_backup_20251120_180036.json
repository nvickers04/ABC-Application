Volatility (VIX ~15) remains subdued, supporting risk assets. Equity sectors show rotation toward technology and renewables amid AI-driven productivity gains and energy transition themes. Commodities exhibit strength in precious metals due to geopolitical tensions and hedging demand. Crypto assets are rebounding with institutional inflows but remain volatile. Broader risks include potential election-year policy shifts and supply chain disruptions. This regime favors diversified growth-oriented allocations with emphasis on momentum leaders, aligning with aggressive ROI goals (10-20% monthly) while capping drawdowns via dynamic rebalancing.
