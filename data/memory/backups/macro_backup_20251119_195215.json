Volatility (VIX ~15) remains subdued, supporting risk assets. Tech and crypto sectors show strong momentum amid AI adoption and ETF inflows, while commodities like platinum benefit from industrial demand and supply constraints. Broader rotation favors cyclicals over defensives, but with equity-bond correlation decoupling. Institutional flows (per latest 13F data) indicate accumulation in tech (XLK holdings up 8% QoQ) and alternatives (BTC/ETH via spot ETFs), with distribution in utilities (XLU). Risk environment: Low systemic risk, but watch geopolitical tensions impacting commodities/currencies. Alignment with goals: Prioritize high-momentum assets for 10-20% monthly ROI potential via leveraged positions, capped at <5% drawdown through diversification and stops. Optimal for sector allocation in tech/crypto/commodities, avoiding overexposure to fixed income amid yield curve normalization.\",\n  \"selected_sectors\": [\n    {\n      \"ticker\": \"XLK\",\n      \"name\": \"Technology\",\n      \"score\": 2.85,\n      \"rationale\": \"Top-ranked on relative strength (1mo +12% vs SPY +8%), momentum acceleration, and institutional accumulation (13F flows +15% in semis/AI leaders like NVDA).
