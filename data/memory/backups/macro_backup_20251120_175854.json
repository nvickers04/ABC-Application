Volatility is moderate (VIX ~15-18), favoring risk assets like equities and select commodities. Tech and energy sectors show relative strength amid AI-driven innovation and geopolitical tensions boosting energy demand. Broader risks include election uncertainty and supply chain disruptions, constraining aggressive positioning.
