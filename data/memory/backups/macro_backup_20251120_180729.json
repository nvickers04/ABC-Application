Volatility is low (VIX ~15), supporting risk assets, but geopolitical tensions (e.g., Middle East) and election uncertainty introduce tail risks. Equity sectors show rotation from mega-cap tech to value and cyclicals, with commodities gaining on supply constraints. Crypto remains correlated to risk sentiment but volatile. Broader regime favors diversified exposure to growth sectors and hard assets for inflation hedging.
