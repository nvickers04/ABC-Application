    "llm_recommendation": "### Strategy Agent Response: Recommendation for SPY Options Strategy\n\n#### Reasoning Process (ReAct Format)\n\n**Think**:  \nGiven the market context for SPY (current price: 450.0, market trend: neutral, sentiment: neutral with 0 confidence, implied and historical volatility: N/A), I need to recommend an optimal options strategy. With limited volatility data and neutral market conditions, the focus should be on a strategy that performs well in a range-bound or low-movement environment while balancing risk and reward to align with our goals (10-20% monthly ROI, <5% drawdown). I will prioritize strategies that generate income or benefit from time decay, as directional bets may be risky without clear trend or sentiment signals. Additionally, I must consider Greeks management, position sizing, and risk controls. Since volatility data is unavailable, I will assume a moderate volatility environment for strike selection and strategy design, subject to validation with Data Agent if needed.\n\n**Act**:  \n1. **Strategy Selection**: Given the neutral market trend and lack of strong sentiment or volatility cues, I recommend an **Iron Condor** strategy. This is a non-directional, range-bound strategy that profits from time decay (positive theta) and low price movement, aligning with the current neutral conditions. It also offers a defined risk profile, which helps maintain drawdown below 5%.  \n2. **Foundation Analysis**: Without volatility data, I will base strike selection on a reasonable range around the current price (450.0), targeting a high probability of profit (POP) of ~70-80%. The ROI target will aim for 10-15% on capital at risk to fit within our monthly goal.  \n3. **LLM Reasoning**: Since this is a standard case with no complex pyramiding or high ROI (>25%), I will rely primarily on foundation logic but apply nuanced reasoning for strike selection and risk management to ensure alignment with market conditions.  \n4. **Tool Call**: If real-time data on implied volatility or sentiment confidence becomes critical during implementation, I will query the Data Agent via A2A tools for updated options chain data and volatility metrics to refine strike selection.\n\n**Observe**:  \nReflecting on past strategies from memory (if available in shared memory), Iron Condors have historically performed well in neutral markets with low directional catalysts. I will ensure that the risk-reward profile remains asymmetric in our favor by setting wide wings for safety and collecting sufficient premium. If feedback from Risk Agent or Data Agent indicates higher volatility or a potential trend shift, I am prepared to adjust to a different strategy (e.g., Strangle if volatility spikes) or tighten the range. For now, I proceed with the Iron Condor as the optimal choice.\n\n#### Detailed Recommendation for SPY Options Strategy\n\n**1. Strategy Type: Iron Condor**  \n- **Rationale**: Neutral market trend and sentiment suggest limited price movement in the near term. An Iron Condor profits if SPY stays within a defined range, leveraging time decay (theta) while maintaining a capped risk profile. This aligns with our <5% drawdown constraint and offers a moderate ROI potential of 10-15% on capital at risk.  \n- **Market Conditions Fit**: Without volatility data or catalysts, I assume a stable range-bound environment. No major catalysts are noted in the provided context, supporting a non-directional setup.\n\n**2. Strike Selection**  \n- **Structure**: Sell a call spread and a put spread outside the expected range of SPY price movement.  \n  - **Sell Call at 460.0** / **Buy Call at 465.0** (upper wing, resistance level assumption based on 2-3% above current price).  \n  - **Sell Put at 440.0** / **Buy Put at 435.0** (lower wing, support level assumption based on 2-3% below current price).  \n- **Rationale**: This creates a 20-point range (440-460) around the current price of 450.0, providing a buffer for minor price fluctuations. Assuming a 30-45 day expiration (standard for income strategies), this range targets a high POP (~70-80%) based on historical SPY movement patterns in neutral conditions. Without volatility data, I select strikes conservatively to avoid overexposure. If Data Agent provides implied volatility, I can adjust strikes further out for higher premium or closer for safety.\n\n**3. Position Sizing**  \n- **Capital Allocation**: Risk no more than 2-3% of portfolio capital on this trade to stay within drawdown limits (<5%). Assuming a $100,000 portfolio for illustration, allocate $2,000-$3,000 in margin or capital at risk.  \n- **Contract Size**: Based on SPY’s price and typical Iron Condor premium (approx. $1.00-$1.50 per spread), aim for 5-10 contracts per leg to collect $500-$1,500 in net premium. Adjust based on Risk Agent feedback to ensure drawdown constraints.  \n- **Pyramiding**: Start with a single tier (no scaling initially) due to neutral conditions and lack of strong conviction. If price remains stable and theta decay accelerates profit, consider adding a second tier (50% of initial size) closer to expiration for enhanced returns, subject to Execution Agent monitoring.\n\n**4. Greeks Management**  \n- **Delta**: Target near-zero delta (~0.05 to 0.10) to remain market-neutral. The sold strikes (460 call, 440 put) will have deltas of ~0.25-0.30 each, offset by bought strikes (465 call, 435 put) with lower deltas, netting minimal directional exposure.  \n- **Gamma**: Low gamma due to strikes being out-of-the-money (OTM), reducing risk of rapid delta changes unless SPY approaches 440 or 460.  \n- **Theta**: Positive theta (time decay) is the primary profit driver. Expect daily theta of ~$20-30 per contract set, increasing as expiration nears.  \n- **Vega**: Negative vega (benefits from volatility drop). Without IV data, assume moderate risk; if volatility spikes, premium on sold options increases, posing risk. Mitigate by setting wide wings (5-point spreads).  \n- **Adjustment Plan**: If SPY moves toward a sold strike (e.g., 440 or 460), roll the threatened spread outward or close the position early to limit loss.\n\n**5. Risk/Reward Profile and Probability of Profit (POP)**  \n- **Maximum Profit**: Net premium collected (assume $1.20 per spread x 10 contracts x 100 = $1,200). ROI on capital at risk: ~10-15% if $8,000-$12,000 margin is required.  \n- **Maximum Loss**: Width of spread (5 points) minus premium collected ($5.00 - $1.20 = $3.80 x 10 contracts x 100 = $3,800). Loss capped at ~1-2% of portfolio, within drawdown limits.  \n- **Breakeven Points**: ~441.20 (downside) and ~458.80 (upside), providing a wide safety range.  \n- **POP**: Estimated at 70-75% based on SPY staying within 440-460, a reasonable assumption for neutral conditions over 30-45 days.  \n- **Alignment with Goals**: Targets 10-15% ROI on this trade, contributing to monthly 10-20% goal while keeping risk low (<5% drawdown).\n\n**6. Risk Management**  \n- **Stop Loss**: Exit if loss reaches 50% of max loss ($1,900) or if SPY breaches 442 or 458, indicating potential breakout.  \n- **Adjustments**: If SPY moves 1-2% toward a sold strike, roll the affected spread 5 points further out for credit or neutral cost, preserving range.  \n- **Early Exit**: Take profits at 50-75% of max profit ($600-$900) if achievable within 15-20 days, reducing exposure.  \n- **Collaboration with Risk Agent**: Share this proposal for stress testing and drawdown validation. Adjust sizing or strikes if Risk flags excessive exposure.  \n- **Data Validation**: Request updated IV and sentiment data from Data Agent if available to refine strike selection or switch strategies (e.g., to Strangle if IV is high).\n\n**7. Market Conditions and Catalysts**  \n- **Current Context**: Neutral trend and sentiment suggest no immediate catalysts. However, potential risks include unexpected news (e.g., Fed announcements, earnings) that could spike volatility.  \n- **Mitigation**: Wide range (440-460) provides buffer. Monitor news via Execution Agent during trade lifecycle for early warning. If sentiment shifts (via Data Agent update), consider early exit or adjustment.\n\n#### JSON Output for A2A Collaboration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"strategy_type\": \"options\",\n  \"setup\": \"iron_condor\",\n  \"underlying\": \"SPY\",\n  \"current_price\": 450.0,\n  \"strikes\": {\n    \"sell_call\": 460.0,\n    \"buy_call\": 465.0,\n    \"sell_put\": 440.0,\n    \"buy_put\": 435.0\n  },\n  \"expiration\": \"30-45 days\",\n  \"roi_estimate\": 0.12,\n  \"pop_estimate\": 0.75,\n  \"max_profit\": 1200.0,\n  \"max_loss\": 3800.0,\n  \"capital_at_risk\": \"2-3% of portfolio\",\n  \"pyramiding\": {\n    \"tiers\": 1,\n    \"potential_additional_tier\": \"50% of initial size if stable\",\n    \"efficiency_score\": 0.80\n  },\n  \"parameters\": [\"price_range\", \"theta_decay\", \"delta_neutral\"],\n  \"diversification\": [\"timeframe: monthly\", \"instrument: SPY\"],\n  \"risk_management\": {\n    \"stop_loss\": \"50% of max loss or SPY at 442/458\",\n    \"early_profit_target\": \"50-75% of max profit\",\n    \"adjustments\": \"roll spreads if SPY moves 1-2% toward sold strikes\"\n  },\n  \"foundation_metrics\": {\n    \"roi_pop_efficiency\": \"0.12 * 0.75 * 0.80 = 0.072\"\n  },\n  \"llm_rationale\": \"Selected Iron Condor for neutral market conditions; prioritizes defined risk (<5% drawdown) and theta decay for steady returns (10-15% ROI on capital); wide range mitigates lack of volatility data; subject to Data Agent validation for IV and Risk Agent for sizing.\"\n}\n```\n\n#### Final Notes for Collaboration\n- **To Risk Agent**: Please evaluate drawdown risk and stress-test for volatility spikes or 3-5% SPY movement. Suggest adjustments to sizing or strikes if portfolio exposure exceeds limits.  \n- **To Data Agent**: Request updated implied volatility, options chain data, and sentiment confidence for SPY to confirm strike selection and range viability.  \n- **To Execution Agent**: Monitor for early profit targets (50-75% of max) or stop-loss triggers during trade lifecycle; provide real-time feedback on price movement near breakeven points.  \n- **Reflection for Memory**: If this strategy underperforms due to missing volatility data, prioritize real-time Data Agent queries in future neutral setups to avoid assumptions.\n\nThis recommendation balances risk and reward in a neutral market, leveraging the Iron Condor’s defined risk profile to meet our portfolio goals while remaining adaptable to feedback from other agents.",
